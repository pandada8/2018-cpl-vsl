		 Obtaining the VC compiler by Electronic Mail
		 ============================================

To obtain files for the vc compiler for VSL, the vas assembler or the VAM
interpreter send a message to jpb=compiler-request@uk.ac.bath.maths or
jpb=cr@uk.ac.bath.maths. The body of the message should have the following
format:

   <one or more commmands>
   end:

Possible commands are as follows

help:

   This will send this help file

index:

   This will send a list of the files available and their sizes

send: <filename>

   This will send the named file. If no file is specified, or the filename
   given is "all", all files for vc, vas and vam will be sent, together with
   some of the information files. Some more specialist files need to be
   requested explicitly. If you want two or more specific files, use two or
   more send: commands.

path: <pathname>

   This is a return address to which any subsequent files will be sent. If it
   is not present files will be sent to the address in the Reply-To: field of
   the message, or failing that the From: field. It makes sense to have this as
   the first command in the message.

If you have problems try sending a message, detailing the problem, to
jpb=compiler-bugs@uk.ac.bath.maths.

Files are supplied strictly on an "as is" basis. I am always pleased to hear
about bugs and suggested improvements, but make no promises about fixing them.
Please send any comments/questions you may have electronically to
jpb=compiler-bugs@uk.ac.bath.maths

There is also now an experimental anonymous ftp service from
axiom.maths.bath.ac.uk where the files may be found in the directory
pub/comp-tech/jpb-book.

Happy programming,
