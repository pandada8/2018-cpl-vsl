This is the distribution directory with the source files for the vc compiler
for VSL, the vas assembler and the VAM interpreter. A make file is provided for
each of these systems, so for example to make the vc compiler use the command

   make -f Makefile-vc

All three make files assume the use of an ANSI C compiler. I have used the GNU
C compiler, gcc, on a SUN-4/260 in developing this system. You may need to edit
the make files if you are using a different compiler (change all occurrences of
gcc to the name of your compiler).

The compiler and assembler are both implemented as filters. The interpreter
takes a single argument, which is the file to interpret.

Recommended usage is thus something like:

   vc file.vsl 
   vas file.vas 
   vam -t file.vam > file.trace.output

The vc code generator picks up standard prologue and library files. The
directory where these are found is set by the line

   #define  LIB_DIR  "/home/jpb/book/distrib/"  /* Library directory */

in vc.h. This should be modified to refer to the directory with the vc source.
Note the / at the end.

Finally some ANSI compilers are likely to need #include <stdlib.h> in
appropriate places.

For reference you may like to note that the minimal VSL program is:

   FUNC main ()
   {
           CONTINUE
   }

These files are supplied strictly on an "as is" basis. I am always pleased to
hear about bugs and suggested improvements, but make no promises about fixing
them. Please send any comments/questions you may have electronically to
jpb=compiler-bugs@uk.ac.bath.maths

The optimiser (added spring 1991) was written as a final year dissertation by
Jonathan R Johnson of Carleton University, USA. My thanks for his efforts. The
shell archives (opt.shar and opt-ex.shar) include the modified files. Any
questions about this optimiser should be sent to him direct,
johnsonj@mathcs.carleton.edu

The VAX MACRO code generator (added summer 1991) was written by Ken Schweller
of Buena Vista College, Iowa. My thanks also for his work. The shell archive
(vaxmacro.shar) includes all the modified files. Any questions about this code
generator should be sent to him direct, schweller@bvc.edu

There is also now an experimental anonymous ftp service from
axiom.maths.bath.ac.uk where the files may be found in the directory
pub/comp-tech/jpb-book.

Happy programming,
